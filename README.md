# EY Data Challenge
EY Data Challenge Repository

## Background:

EY Data Challenge comprised of Hospital Emergency Department Data with patients admission and discharge attributes such as Patient Arrival Time, Departure Time, Diagnosis Type, Complaint Type, Age etc.

For this challenge, I trained a supervised machine-learning model that captures key features such age, complaint type, diagnosis type and relapse rate in making a medical triage priority assessment.
